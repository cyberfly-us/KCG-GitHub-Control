**KCG GitHub Control**

KCG GitHub Control was written out of frustration. It is just a GUI for the basics of the [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command that I was using to put an update my repositories on GitHub. I had started out using the command line for [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and didn’t like trying to remember all the commands to type. I looked at a number of GUI’s but they were more complex than I needed. This simply uses the Shell command in XOJO to help automate the process. You can download the compiled version for Windows on my website <HTTP://KCG-Software.com>.

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed to use it. The [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) link on the programs window will take you to the web page to download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The Documentation button will display the instructions for using it.

This is set to run as Administrator because that is how I started out doing it from the command line. You may want to change it to run as user depending on how you have uploaded your GitHub repositories in the past.

I wrote it and tested it on Windows. But I wrote it to run on MacOS and Linux as well. So, it should run on those platforms as well. I put both the text version and the binary version out here. I prefer binary projects and GitHub works best with the text version.
